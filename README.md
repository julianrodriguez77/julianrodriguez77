<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
I'm a versatile developer, with experience in building web platforms.<br>I like accessibility, performance and robust code. In addition, I also like to help and communicate as much as I can. I usually answer questions or solve some issues on GitHub, Stack Overflow or on tech communities because that not only helps others, but also helps me.
<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
I've experience working in a private company and as a freelancer.
I've spent most of my time as a developer with the following stacks:
